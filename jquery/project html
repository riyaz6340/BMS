        <p class="parafirst ">
            Flight is a 2012 American drama film directed by 
Robert Zemeckis. The film stars Denzel Washington as William "Whip" Whitaker Sr.
, an airline pilot who miraculously crash-lands his plane after it suffers an in-flight mechanical
 failure, saving nearly everyone on board. Immediately following the crash, he is hailed a hero, 
but an investigation soon leads to questions that put the captain in a different light.
Flight was the first live action film directed by Robert Zemeckis since Cast Away and What Lies 
Beneath, both released in 2000, and his first R-rated film since Used Cars in 1980. It was also a 
box office success, grossing over $161 million worldwide and received mostly positive reviews. The 
film was nominated twice at the 85th Academy Awards, for Best Actor (Denzel Washington) and Best Original
 Screenplay (John Gatins).

        <h2>Flights :</h2>
        <p class="para">
            Airline pilot captain William "Whip" Whitaker Sr. uses cocaine to wake up after a night of little 
            sleep in his Orlando hotel room. He pilots SouthJet Flight 227 to Atlanta which experiences severe 
            turbulence at takeoff. Copilot Ken Evans takes over while Whip discreetly mixes vodka in his orange
            juice and takes a nap. He is jolted awake as the plane goes into a steep dive. Unable to regain control,
            Whip is forced to make a controlled crash landing in an open field losing consciousness on impact.
Meanwhile, heroin addict Nicole Maggen is on the verge of being evicted. She overdoses on heroin and has to be wheeled 
out of the house by a paramedic. SouthJet Flight 227 flies inverted overhead in the midst of its emergency landing.
Whip awakens in an Atlanta hospital with moderate injuries and is greeted by his old friend Charlie Anderson, who represents 
the airline's pilots union. He tells Whip that he managed to save 96 out of 102, losing two crew members and four passengers,
but mentions his copilot is in a coma. Whip sneaks away for a cigarette in the stairwell and meets Nicole, who is recovering 
from a heroin overdose in the same hospital. The next morning, his friend and drug dealer Harling Mays picks him up from the hospital.
Having retired to his late father's farm, he meets Charlie and attorney Hugh Lang, who explain that the National Transportation 
Safety Board (NTSB) performed a drug test while he was unconscious. Results showed that Whip was intoxicated during the flight. 
Hugh promises to get the toxicology report voided on technical grounds. Meanwhile, Whip visits and soon becomes intimate with 
Nicole, but Whip's drinking habits clash with Nicole's attempts to stay drug-free. Later at a crew member's funeral, he attempts
to persuade a flight attendant who survived to tell the NTSB that he was sober.
Whip pays a visit to his co-pilot Ken Evans after he awakens from his coma. Evans has likely lost much of his ability to walk 
and may never pilot an airplane again. Although upset, Evans has no intention of telling the NTSB that Whip was drinking. Nicole 
decides to separate from Whip, following his failed attempts to stay sober. Hounding Whip, the media catches him drunk after he 
spontaneously drives to the home of his ex-wife and son, both of whom resent him. He stays with Charlie until the NTSB hearing, 
vowing not to drink. The night before the hearing, Charlie and Hugh move Whip to a guarded hotel room with no alcohol. Although 
his minibar is empty, he finds the door to an adjacent room unlocked and raids its minibar instead.
Whip is discovered by Charlie the next morning, passed out and still drunk. Harling is called, who revives him with cocaine. 
At the hearing, lead NTSB investigator Ellen Block explains that a damaged elevator assembly jackscrew was the primary cause 
of the crash. She commends Whip on his valor and skill and notes that no other pilot was able to land the plane in trial 
simulations of the crash. She then reveals that two empty vodka bottles were found in the plane's trash, despite the fact
that beverages had not been served to passengers, and that Whip's test was excluded for technical reasons. The only other 
member of the crew to test positive for alcohol was Trina, who died in the crash, and with whom Whip had spent the night 
before. Whip, unable to bring himself to blame Trina for his actions, admits to being intoxicated the day of the crash.
Thirteen months later, an imprisoned Whip tells a support group of fellow inmates that he's glad to be sober and doesn't 
regret doing the right thing. Whip is seen looking at pictures of Nicole, family, and friends on the wall of his cell, 
along with greeting cards congratulating him on being sober for a year. He is working to rebuild his relationship with 
his son, who visits to talk with him about a college application essay on "the most fascinating person that I've never met." 
His son begins by asking, "Who are you?" As a plane flies overhead, Whip replies, "That's a good question."

            Historically city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but today, following 
            two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, half of 
            the world population is said to live in cities. This has profound
            consequences for global sustainability.[6] Present-day cities 
            usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban 
            areas - creating numerous commuters traveling towards city 
            centers for employment, entertainment, and edification. However,

            A city is distinguished from other human settlements by its relatively
            great size, but also by its functions and its special symbolic
            status, which may be conferred by a central authority. The term
            can also refer either to the physical streets and buildings of 
            the city or to the collection of people who dwell there, and can
            be used in a general sense to mean urban rather than rural 
            territory.[13][14]
A variety of definitions, invoking population, population 
density, number 
of dwellings, economic function, and infrastructure, are used 
in national censuses to classify populations as urban. Common 
population definitions for a city range between 1,500 and 50,000 
people, with most states using a minimum between 1,500 and 5000 
inhabitants.[15][16] However, some jurisdictions set no such 
minimums.[17] According to the "functional definition" a city 
is not distinguished by size alone, but also by the role it 
plays within a larger political context. Cities serve as 
administrative, commercial, religious, and cultural hubs for 
their larger surrounding areas.[18][19]
The presence of a literate elite is sometimes included in 
the definition.[20] A typical city has professional 
administrators, regulations, and some form of taxation 
(food and other necessities or means to trade for them) 
to feed the government workers. (This arrangement contrasts 
with the more typically horizontal relationships in a tribe or 
village accomplishing common goals through informal agreements 
between neighbors, or through leadership of a chief.) The 
governments may be based on heredity, religion, military power,
work projects such as canal building, food distribution, land 
ownership, agriculture, commerce, manufacturing, finance, or a 
combination of these. Societies that live in cities are often 
called civilizations.

called civilizations.
            A city is distinguished from other human settlements by its relatively
            great size, but also by its functions and its special symbolic
            status, which may be conferred by a central authority. The term
            can also refer either to the physical streets and buildings of 
            the city or to the collection of people who dwell there, and can
            be used in a general sense to mean urban rather than rural 
            territory.[13][14]
A variety of definitions, invoking population, population 
density, number 
of dwellings, economic function, and infrastructure, are used 
in national censuses to classify populations as urban. Common 
population definitions for a city range between 1,500 and 50,000 
people, with most states using a minimum between 1,500 and 5000 
inhabitants.[15][16] However, some jurisdictions set no such 
minimums.
